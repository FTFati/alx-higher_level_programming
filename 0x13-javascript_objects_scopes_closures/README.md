# Javascript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

In this second Holberton JavaScript project I dived into the infamously fun
aspects of the language - scope, closures and `this`. I practiced working with
objects and ES6-style classes.

## General:

* Why Javascript programming is amazing (donâ€™t forget to tweet today, with the
  hashtag #javascriptisamazing :))
* How to create an object in Javascript
* What this means
* What undefined means
* Why the variable type and scope is important
* What is a closure
* What is a prototype
* How to inherit an object from another
